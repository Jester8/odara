## **2. Prerequisites**

Before running Odara, ensure you have the following installed:

# Install dependencies
npm install
# OR using yarn
yarn install
```

This will install all required libraries such as **React Navigation**, **Axios**, **Redux Toolkit**, and other project dependencies.

---

## **5. Starting the App**

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the app:

```bash
# Start the Expo development server
npx expo start
```

You will see the **Metro Bundler** start in your terminal or browser.

```

Ensure that the `.env` file is not committed to version control (add it to `.gitignore`).
